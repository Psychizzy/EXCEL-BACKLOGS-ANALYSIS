# Backlog Analysis and Dashboard using Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview
This project aims to streamline order fulfillment and optimize supply chain operations using Microsoft Excel. Through this analysis, we identify key issues causing delays and backlogs in the system, and we provide actionable insights and recommendations. The analysis covers various aspects including backlog issues, delivery delays, driver performance, route efficiency, and vehicle allocation.


## Problem

At Streamline Logistics Solutions, we face several critical challenges in our order fulfillment process:

- **Mounting Order Backlogs:** Inefficiencies in routing and resource allocation have caused a growing backlog of orders, negatively impacting delivery timelines and customer satisfaction.

- **Visibility Gap:** Customers often lack real-time updates on their order status, resulting in communication gaps and rising dissatisfaction.

- **Customer Frustration:** Frequent complaints regarding delayed deliveries and poor communication are damaging our reputation for reliability.

- **Escalating Costs:** Operational expenses are increasing due to overtime payments and the need for expedited shipping to clear backlogs, which threatens profitability.

## Rationale for the Project

Order fulfillment is the process of receiving, processing, and delivering customer orders. It involves activities such as inventory management, order processing, picking and packing products, and shipping them to customers. Backlogs, in this context, refer to the accumulation of unprocessed orders due to delays, which can arise from high demand, operational inefficiencies, or unforeseen disruptions. These backlogs impact customer satisfaction by causing delays in delivery.

Addressing backlogs is crucial to ensuring timely and reliable order fulfillment. In the logistics and supply chain industry, efficiency is a necessity, not merely a goal. The rationale for this project is driven by the following:

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Enhancing our order fulfillment processes directly impacts customer satisfaction and nurtures long-term relationships.

- **Operational Efficiency:** By improving efficiency, we save costs, improve profitability, and strengthen our competitive position.

- **Data-Driven Insights:** Leveraging data helps optimize resource allocation and routing, ensuring better delivery times and resource management.

- **Reputation Management:** Solving operational challenges preserves the companyâ€™s reputation for reliability and consistent excellence.

## Aim of the Project

The primary aim of this project is to develop an Excel-based interactive dashboard that provides visibility into our order fulfillment processes. Through this dashboard, we aim to:

- Efficiently allocate delivery resources based on order volume and location.
- Monitor order progress and identify potential delays proactively.
- Improve customer communication with timely delivery updates.
- Reduce order backlogs and operational costs.
- Enhance overall customer satisfaction and maintain our reputation as an industry leader.

## Key Insights

1. **Order Backlog Issue:** Out of 1500 orders, 767 remain incomplete. This substantial backlog presents a significant challenge, affecting both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

2. **Delivery Delays:** The average delay across all orders is approximately 14.51 minutes. While it may seem modest, over time, these delays contribute to the growing backlog.

3. **Feedback vs. Delays:** Orders with positive feedback exhibit slightly higher delays than those with negative feedback. This indicates other factors like customer service or product quality might be compensating for delivery delays.

4. **Driver Performance:** Drivers D86, D44, and D29 have notably higher delays compared to others, indicating potential areas for performance improvement through training or route optimization.

5. **Route Delays:** Routes 3, 1, and 2 show consistently higher delays. Investigating these routes for potential obstacles like traffic patterns or longer distances is necessary to optimize performance.

6. **Vehicle Delays:** Deliveries made using "BikeC" experience higher delays compared to "VanA". This might be due to limitations in speed, cargo capacity, or the range of the vehicle.

7. **Allocation Rule Inefficiencies:** The "Expedite Rules" show slightly higher delays than the "Custom Rules" and "Standard Rules," highlighting inefficiencies in the current allocation system.

## Recommendations

1. **Resource Allocation:** Allocate additional resources to address the backlog and prevent further accumulation, either temporarily or on a more permanent basis.

2. **Driver Training & Evaluation:** Provide additional training for drivers with consistently higher delays and introduce better route planning tools or vehicle maintenance checks.

3. **Route Optimization:** Reevaluate high-delay routes for potential improvements in traffic analysis, delivery times, or other contributing factors.

4. **Vehicle Allocation:** Reassess the use of "BikeC" for deliveries, especially for longer routes, and consider alternative vehicle types for better performance.

5. **Review Allocation Rules:** The "Expedite Rules" need revision to ensure they reduce delays. Focus on improving "Custom Rules" since they seem to perform better in terms of reducing delays.

6. **Enhance Customer Communication:** Improving customer communication channels regarding order status, expected delays, and concerns can enhance overall satisfaction and support the company's goals.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (for data analysis and dashboard creation)
- Intermediate to advanced Excel functions (for analysis)
